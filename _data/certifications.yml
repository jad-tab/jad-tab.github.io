- title: "Introduction to DeepLearning on Pytorch (DataCamp)"
  platform: "Using the (overused) MNIST dataset, I have learned to build basic (feedforward) neural networks and then I saw how convolutional neural networks could be used to build  more accurate models. Finer concepts are also addressed in the final chapter: regularization techniques, transfer learning."
