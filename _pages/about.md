I was born in Beirut, Lebanon, not far from here:

I moved to France in 2013 to pursue my education. 

I have a love and passion for mathematics and their applications. I hold a Master's degree in Pure and Applied Mathematics as well as a Master's degree in Data Science and Machine Learning.

This website is meant to serve as a portfolio to showcase some of my data science projects. I would also like to share some of the beautiful things I've stumbled upon during my mathematical journey. 


Thank you for stopping by !
