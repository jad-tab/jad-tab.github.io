My name is Jad. I was born in Beirut, Lebanon before moving to France in 2013. 

I have a love and passion for mathematics and their applications. I hold a Master's degree in Pure and Applied Mathematics as well as a Master's degree in Data Science and Machine Learning.

This website is meant to serve as a portfolio to showcase some of my Data Science projects. I would also like to share some of the beautiful things I've stumbled upon during my mathematical journey. 


Thank you for stopping by !
