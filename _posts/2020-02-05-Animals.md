About 100 000 cats and dogs are abandonned by their owners every year in France. Some of them are left to a cruel fate, and on some rare occasions have to be taken away from their owners for abuse.
The SPA (Société de Protection des Animaux) fosters about 40 000 of these animals. Here are a few cute animals you can adopt from [Animals Lebanon](http://www.animalslebanon.org/)

But what happens to them after that ? 
Unfortunately, with the ever-increasing number of abandonned animals, some can stay fostered long enough to die in the shelter. Others may even have to be euthanized. And a lucky few are offered a new home after being adopted.

Is it possible to predict what happens to these fostered animals down the road using their characteristics ? (such as their age, breed, color...).

Using a dataset from the [Shelter Animal Outcomes (Kaggle Competition)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/overview), I'm going to build predictive models to predict the animals' destinies. Though the dataset comes from a competition, I'm not focusing here on building the most accurate model possible. Instead, I will take my time preprocessing the data and cleaning it: as we're going to see, the real world data isn't always very tidy and requires some extra steps.

Also, I'd like to omit some parts of the below code for readability, but I will provide a link to the full notebook on my github.

And also, just a foreword: I'll use the multiclass logarithmic function which is a way to measure how good the predictions are. After training the algorithm, I will determine for each animal $$i$$ all the probabilities for it to be in the class $$j$$, $$j$$ being one of those categories ('Adoption', 'Died', 'Euthanasia', 'Return to owner', and 'Transfer'). Then I will compute the following quantity:

$$LogLoss = \frac{-1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \sum_{j = 1}^M y_{ij} log(p_{ij})$$

Where:

* $$M = 5$$ (number of outcome classes), 
* $$y_{ij} = 1$$ (if observation $$i$$ is in outcome $$j$$), $$y_{ij} = 0$$ (if observation $$i$$ is not in outcome $$j$$).


Let's get coding. I start by importing the relevant functions and to import and visualize the data:

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import log_loss
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV


complete_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv.gz')
complete_data.head()
```

## Dropping some features, converting some others

I'm going to drop the animal's names to begin with, as well as the animal ID's.
The 'OutcomeSubtype' is not necessary because it does not provide any additional information: it's only known after the 'Outcometype' has been determined (it is only a qualitative precision after the animal departs and including it might create a bias in the characteristics). 

I'll also make the SexUponOutcome 'atomic' (since it contains two information at the same time: whether the animal has been castrated and whether itis male or female). I'll split it into two columns. 

AgeUponOutcome represents the age in time units (years, months, weeks, days) but for the sake of simplicity, I'll adopt a year-base convention. Let's just say that $$1 \text{ year} \approx 365 \text{ days} \approx 52 \text{ weeks}$$.

All the variables (except for the age) are categorical variables: I'll later convert them to categorical variables.



```python
#Remove AnimalID, Name and Outcome Subtype
#Transform the 'Castrated' column into 0 for all Intact animals and 1 for all the Neutered and Spayed animals. 

complete_data = complete_data[complete_data.columns.difference(('AnimalID', 'Name', 'OutcomeSubtype'))].copy()

complete_data.loc[complete_data['Castrated']=='Intact', 'Castrated'] = 0
complete_data.loc[complete_data['Castrated'].isin(('Neutered', 'Spayed')), 'Castrated'] = 1

```
