About 100 000 cats and dogs are abandonned by their owners every year in France. Some of them are left to a cruel fate, and on some rare occasions have to be taken away from their owners for abuse.
The SPA (Société de Protection des Animaux) fosters about 40 000 of these animals. 

But what happens to them after that ? 
Unfortunately, with the ever-increasing number of abandonned animals, some can stay fostered long enough to die in the shelter. Others may even have to be euthanized. And a lucky few are offered a new home after being adopted.

Is it possible to predict what happens to these fostered animals down the road using their characteristics ? (such as their age, breed, color...).

Using a dataset from the [Shelter Animal Outcomes (Kaggle Competition)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/overview), I'm going to build predictive models to predict the animals' destinies.
