[STC (Saudi Telecom Company)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Telecom_Company) is one of the largest digital companies in the Middle East with millions of subscribers to their services. 
And to keep so many subscribers happy, STC needs to leverage on their feedback: I've had the opportunity to work on a project for STC in terms of customer satisfaction. Every day, STC's customer support receives hundreds of questions and requests. Hundreds of comments flock everyday on their social media pages by all sorts of people: happy or angry customers.

Using a dataset from the [Shelter Animal Outcomes (Kaggle Competition)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/overview), I'm going to build predictive models to predict the animals' destinies. Though the dataset comes from a Kaggle competition, I'm not focusing here on building the most accurate model possible. Instead, I will take my time preprocessing the data and cleaning it: as we're going to see, the real world data isn't always very tidy and requires some extra steps.

* $$M = 5$$ (number of outcome classes), 
* $$y_{ij} = 1$$ (if observation $$i$$ is in outcome $$j$$), $$y_{ij} = 0$$ (if observation $$i$$ is not in outcome $$j$$).

If you're too eager to know what happened to Gus and Skooter, check the last sect
```python
#Remove AnimalID, Name and Outcome Subtype
#Transform the 'Castrated' column into 0 for all Intact animals and 1 for all the Neutered and Spayed animals. 

complete_data = complete_data[complete_data.columns.difference(('AnimalID', 'Name', 'OutcomeSubtype'))].copy()

complete_data.loc[complete_data['Castrated']=='Intact', 'Castrated'] = 0
complete_data.loc[complete_data['Castrated'].isin(('Neutered', 'Spayed')), 'Castrated'] = 1

```
