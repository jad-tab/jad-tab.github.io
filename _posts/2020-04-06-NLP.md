[STC (Saudi Telecom Company)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Telecom_Company) is one of the largest digital companies in the Middle East with millions of subscribers to their services. 
But how does STC keep so many subscribers happy ? 

There's no doubt that STC leverages on the feedback of their users and thankfully they receive plenty of that: Every day, STC's customer support receives hundreds of questions and requests. Hundreds of people flock everyday to their social media pages to voice their concerns or ask for technical assistance. The volume of this valuable feedback can easily become overwhelming even with an amazing and reactive customer support service.

Can we use posts from Instagram, Facebook or the Call Center to draw useful quantitative insights about customers ? How can we convert a large bucket of words into quantifiable insights, to answer questions like:

* How are the customers feeling in general ?

* What are their main concerns brought up by clients ? Are there some technical problems specific to one area/location ?  Do some technical problems arise on specific days of the year ?

* Are employees responding promptly and positively to customers ?

That's where Machine Learning and Maths can come to the rescue. I've had the opportunity to work on a project for STC at the beginning of 2020 in which I've attempted to answer some questions using thousands of social media comments, as well as customer support center data. 




In this article, I would like to share some of the tools I used in that project to answer some interesting questions. For obvious privacy reasons however, I am going to use mock data and we will explore the methodology on a rival company's dataset: CrabMobile. 





 
```python
#Remove AnimalID, Name and Outcome Subtype
#Transform the 'Castrated' column into 0 for all Intact animals and 1 for all the Neutered and Spayed animals. 

complete_data = complete_data[complete_data.columns.difference(('AnimalID', 'Name', 'OutcomeSubtype'))].copy()

complete_data.loc[complete_data['Castrated']=='Intact', 'Castrated'] = 0
complete_data.loc[complete_data['Castrated'].isin(('Neutered', 'Spayed')), 'Castrated'] = 1

```
