[STC (Saudi Telecom Company)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Telecom_Company) is one of the  most prominent digital companies in the Middle East with millions of subscribers to their services. 
But how does STC keep so many subscribers happy ? 

There's no doubt that they leverage on the feedback of their users and thankfully, they receive plenty of that: Every day, STC's customer support receives hundreds of questions and requests. Hundreds of people flock everyday to their social media pages to voice their concerns or ask for technical assistance. The volume of this valuable feedback can easily become overwhelming even with an amazing and reactive customer support service.

Can we use posts from Instagram, Facebook or the Call Center to draw useful quantitative insights ? 
That's where statistics can come to the rescue !

How can we convert a large bucket of words into quantifiable insights, to answer questions like:

* How are the customers feeling in general ? Are there a specitif subset of the customers who are most satisfied than others ?

* What are their main concerns ? Are there some technical problems specific to one area/location ?  Do some technical problems arise on specific days of the year ?

* Do some problems occur together ?

* Are employees responding promptly and positively to customers ?


I've had the opportunity to work on a project for STC at the beginning of 2020 in which I attempted to answer questions like the above using thousands of social media comments, as well as customer support center data. 
For obvious privacy concerns, I will not be using actual data from STC in this article. Instead, I am going to present things using mock data from one of their competitors: CrabMobile.

CrabMobile is a telecom company based in Dubai. They've just released a new service and are advertising it on instagram.
