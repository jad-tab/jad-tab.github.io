[STC (Saudi Telecom Company)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Telecom_Company) is one of the largest digital companies in the Middle East with millions of subscribers to their services. 
But how does STC keep so many subscribers happy ? 

There's no doubt that STC seeks to leverage on the feedbacks of their clients, and thankfully they receive plenty of that: Every day, STC's customer support receives hundreds of questions and requests. Hundreds of people flock everyday to their social media pages, often posting comments of gratitude or disappointment. The volume of this valuable feedback can easily become overwhelming even with an amazing and reactive customer service. 

Can we use posts from Instagram, Facebook or the Call Center to draw useful insights about STC's customers ?
But... there is so many of them !

That's where Machine Learning and Maths can come to the rescue. I've had the opportunity to work on a project for STC at the beginning of 2020 in which I've attempted to answer some questions using thousands of social media comments, as well as customer support center data. 

In this article, I would like to share some of the tools I used in that project to answer some interesting questions. For obvious privacy reasons however, I am going to use mock data and we will explore the methodology on a rival company's dataset: CrabMobile.

```python
#Remove AnimalID, Name and Outcome Subtype
#Transform the 'Castrated' column into 0 for all Intact animals and 1 for all the Neutered and Spayed animals. 

complete_data = complete_data[complete_data.columns.difference(('AnimalID', 'Name', 'OutcomeSubtype'))].copy()

complete_data.loc[complete_data['Castrated']=='Intact', 'Castrated'] = 0
complete_data.loc[complete_data['Castrated'].isin(('Neutered', 'Spayed')), 'Castrated'] = 1

```
