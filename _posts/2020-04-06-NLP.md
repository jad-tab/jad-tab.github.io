[STC (Saudi Telecom Company)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Telecom_Company) is one of the largest digital companies in the Middle East with millions of subscribers to their services. 
And to keep so many subscribers happy, STC needs to leverage on the feedback. Every day, STC's customer support receives hundreds of questions and requests. Hundreds of people flock everyday to their social media pages, often posting comments of gratitude or of profound... disappointment. The volume of this valuable feedback can be overwhelming even with an amazing customer service. 

That's where Machine Learning and Maths can come to the rescue. But what does Math have to do with Instagram you might ask ?

I've had the opportunity to work on a project for STC at the beginning of 2020 in which I've attempted to answer some questions using thousands of social media comments, as well as customer support center data. In this article, I would like to share with you some of the tools I used in that project to answer some interesting questions. For obvious privacy reasons however, I am going to use mock data and we will explore the methodology on another company's dataset: CrabMobile.

```python
#Remove AnimalID, Name and Outcome Subtype
#Transform the 'Castrated' column into 0 for all Intact animals and 1 for all the Neutered and Spayed animals. 

complete_data = complete_data[complete_data.columns.difference(('AnimalID', 'Name', 'OutcomeSubtype'))].copy()

complete_data.loc[complete_data['Castrated']=='Intact', 'Castrated'] = 0
complete_data.loc[complete_data['Castrated'].isin(('Neutered', 'Spayed')), 'Castrated'] = 1

```
