Let us go back to the animal shelter we have helped by predicting the animals' outcomes. Suppose now we would like to help the shelter prepare for the next season:  how can we predict what the arriving animals might look like in order to best prepare the shelter (buying more cat/dog food, buying more grooming products for furry animals, etc) ?

## Statistical framework
Let $$p_{\theta}(x)$$ be a family of density functions that can be described using a finite set of parameters $$\theta$$. For example, taking the gaussian densities would require us to specify $$\theta = (\mu ; \sigma)$$ to be uniquely specified.
